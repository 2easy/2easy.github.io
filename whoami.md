Modern world is ruled by software, there is nothing you can do about it. Recent security incidents have shown us we are NOT secure. Not even close to it. We want to colonise mars, yet we cannot secure a web camera. With recent AI trend security get's even more complicated. Needless to say it all begins with us - engineers, as the creators of the modern world. I'm here to share everything I learn, so togheter we can create a safer world.

In addition to software security I'm also hooked on sport climbing. I'm creating a platform for climbers and coaches to share training knowledge. It will be available [soon][climbeast].

I am available for hire. You can see my resume [here][resume] and my code on github {% include icon-github.html username="2easy" %}.
